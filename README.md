# Algorithm Project

## Overview
This project contains an implementation of an algorithm in JavaScript. The code is structured to achieve optimal performance while maintaining readability and ease of use. It can be adapted or extended to suit a variety of use cases.

## Features
- Efficient algorithm implementation.
- Well-structured and commented code for clarity.
- Modular design for easy integration into larger projects.

## Prerequisites
Before using this project, ensure that you have the following:
- Node.js installed on your machine (recommended version: 14.x or later).
- A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code, for making modifications.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   If the project uses any dependencies, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Code**:
   Execute the script with Node.js:
   ```bash
   node algorithm.js
   ```

4. **Modify the Code**:
   Open `algorithm.js` in your preferred code editor to make any changes or enhancements.

## Usage
- To integrate this algorithm into your project, import or copy the relevant functions from `algorithm.js` into your codebase.
- Ensure to pass appropriate inputs as per the function specifications.

## Code Structure
- `algorithm.js`: Contains the main algorithm implementation.
- Additional files (if any) are modular components supporting the main script.
